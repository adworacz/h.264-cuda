X264 CUDA
---------

The primary focus of this project is to revitalize and improve the work done by
Alex Rothberg and Lawrence Chan in the original h.264-cuda project.

The project went off the map in 2009 and has not been updated since. Right now 
I'm working on updating the source code to run on the latest versions of CUDA 
(4.2 at the time of this writing) as well as merging with the latest version of 
x264.

Further plans include removing dependencies on the CUDA SDK, as frankly they are just 
unnecessary.
